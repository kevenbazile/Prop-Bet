Use at your own discretion I am not here to present this as anything other then a dope project made with and using ai to debug and ensure my logic was correct. 

what i learned was ai developing is scrambling your brains not mine, as a person who does not activily use ai tp program just code the difference is there but seems like it isnt. I struggled with english growing up so i knew what
i wanted to say all the time could not translate it until i just sat there and it freakng made sense like it actually started to sound like "whats your name not mew mew mew mew mew " so when we talk about ai talking over the world
or making some jobs obsolete no it will if anything show you people who you think do not know how to program actually understnd how to program we just do not know how to code 


enjoy the app
